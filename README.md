# Life Expectancy Analysis R
This repository contains the code and analysis files for exploring the Life Expectancy dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The dataset provides various features related to healthcare and socioeconomic factors, which can be used to predict life expectancy.

# Files
* **Poster.pdf:** This file is a visual summary of the project, which includes images, charts, and graphs to illustrate key findings.
* **Final Version.Rmd:** An R Markdown file containing the final code for this project
* **Life_Expectancy_Analysis.Rmd:** An R Markdown file containing the code, analysis, and visualizations for exploring the dataset, calculating correlations, performing statistical testing, and building predictive models using linear regression, random forest, and support vector regression (SVR) in R.
* **Life_Expectancy_Analysis.ipynb:** A python Notebook containing the Python equivalent of the R code for building predictive models using SVR.
* **Life_Expectancy_Analysis.pdf:** A pdf file contains explanation for each line of code in R Markdown and python Notebook
* **About_Dataset.txt:** a txt file contains short explanation for each column in the dataset

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at the following link: [Life Expectancy - WHO](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). Please download the dataset from the provided link before running the code.

# Problem Statement
The analysis should aim to answer questions such as:
* Are there anomalies in the dataset that need to be addressed?
* Are there any significant differences in life expectancy across countries or regions?
* Are there any trends or patterns in life expectancy over time?
* What are the factors influencing life expectancy?
* Can a predictive model (Random Forest) be developed to accurately predict life expectancy?

# Objective
The objective of this task is to perform EDA on the Life Expectancy dataset that can provide meaningful insights and visualizations so that we can create a predictive model to predict Life Expectancy.
